# Git & GitHub Exercises

## **Task 1: Version Control & Branching**

### **Objective:**
Learn the basics of version control by creating a repository, working with branches, and making pull requests.

### **Steps:**
1. Create a new Git repository on GitHub (or any Git hosting service).
2. Clone the repository locally.
3. Navigate to the repository directory.
4. Create a new branch called `feature-update`.
5. Add a new file named `README.md` and write a short introduction about yourself.
6. Stage and commit the changes.
7. Push the `feature-update` branch to the remote repository.
8. Open a pull request (PR) on GitHub to merge `feature-update` into `main`.
9. Merge the PR after reviewing changes.

### **Solution:**
#### Step 1: Create a repository
- Navigate to GitHub and create a new repository "NexaScale-Git"

#### Step 2: Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/cliuzy/NexaScale-Git
```
**Expected Result:** The repository is copied to your local machine.

#### Step 3: Navigate to the repository directory
```sh
cd Nexascale
```

#### Step 4: Create a new branch
